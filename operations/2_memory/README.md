## Memory
1. **RAM access time**: Report latency for individual integer accesses to main memory and the L1 and L2 caches. Present results as a graph with the x-axis as the log of the size of the memory region accessed, and the y-axis as the average latency. Note that the lmbench paper is a good reference for this experiment. In terms of the lmbench paper, measure the "back-to-back-load" latency and report your results in a graph similar to Fig. 1 in the paper. You should not need to use information about the machine or the size of the L1, L2, etc., caches when implementing the experiment; the experiment will reveal these sizes. In your graph, label the places that indicate the different hardware regimes (L1 to L2 transition, etc.).
2. **RAM bandwidth**: Report bandwidth for both reading and writing. Use loop unrolling to get more accurate results, and keep in mind the effects of cache line prefetching (e.g., see the lmbench paper).
3. **Page fault service time**: Report the time for faulting an entire page from disk (mmap is one useful mechanism). Dividing by the size of a page, how does it compare to the latency of accessing a byte from main memory?
